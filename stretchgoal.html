     <h3>Focus</h3>
      <p>You can use the autofocus attribute in HTML to automatically focus an input element when the page loads. This attribute is particularly useful for improving user experience by bringing immediate attention to a specific input field.</p>

      <h3>Select & Input on mobile</h3>
      <p>I found that the select element is the same on desktop and mobile. When I tried to do the input type date the mobile version it was different to the desktop version, as if it automatically tailors to mobile devices. The differences are subtle but I guess there are not many differences to how they function.</p>
